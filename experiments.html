<H4>DeepMind internship project: Pinata - agent gets a reward if it touches the heaviest object</H4>
<p>This is an extended work of "Which is heavier?" experiment from <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1nTpv9eg&noteId=r1nTpv9eg" target=_blank>Learning to Perform Physics Experiments via Deep Reinforcement Learning (Denil et al. ICLR 2017)</a>.<br>Object densities are shown at the bottom right.</p>

<a href="./resources/str2desc.p" target=_blank>str2desc.p: Mapping between string code to descriptions (Python dictionary).</a><br>
<p> The embedding matrix <i>codeEmb.npy</i> has the shape 27523 by 200. Each row is a specific medical concept (diagnosis code, medication code or procedure code) represented by a 200 dimensional vector. <i>int2str.p</i> is a Python dictionary that maps the dimension number of the embedding matrix to the string code of the medical concept. For example the first dimension of codeEmb.npy can be mapped to a string code "D_401.9". The first letter of the string code could be D, R, or P which respectively stand for diagnosis, medication and procedure. <i>str2desc.p</i> is a Python dictionary that maps the string code to the actual description of the medical concept. For example, the string code "D_401.9" is mapped to the string description "Unspecified essential hypertension".</p>
